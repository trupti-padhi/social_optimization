# Dataset

The dataset contains 100 simulated records of social media campaigns with the following columns:

Platform: The platform where the campaign was run (e.g., Instagram, Facebook).

Content Type: Video, Image, Text Post.

Audience Demographics: Age group of the target audience.

Impressions: Total impressions generated by the campaign.

Engagement Rate (%): Percentage of engaged users.

Ad Spend (USD): Amount spent on the campaign.

ROI (%): Return on investment as a percentage.

Conversions: Number of desired actions (e.g., sign-ups, purchases).

# Steps in the Project

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and data types.

Created new features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed platform performance, content type effectiveness, and audience engagement trends.

Feature Engineering:

Created dummy variables for categorical features.

Normalized numerical features for machine learning models.

Machine Learning:

Defined a binary target variable: Campaign success (1 for above-average conversions, 0 otherwise).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Trained and evaluated models.

Visualization:

Presented results using confusion matrices and feature importance plots.

Insights & Recommendations:

Identified best platforms and content types for campaign success.

Project Highlights

Accuracy: Achieved 89% accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier.

Insights: Key factors like ROI, engagement rate, and platform significantly influence campaign success.

Actionable Strategies: Provided data-driven recommendations for marketing teams.
